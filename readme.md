# Project Obsidian

Project Obsidian is a Resonite plugin that introduces added Protoflux nodes and features. It serves as an experimental space for testing concepts and expanding the boundaries of the virtual reality platform. The primary goal of Project Obsidian is to realize ideas that the base game does not yet feature.

Key features and benefits of Project Obsidian include:

- Incorporating community-driven ideas from both the Project Obsidian Discord and the main Resonite GitHub repository.
- Trialing new concepts and functionalities that could elevate the Resonite experience.
- Regularly engaging with users to accumulate feedback and suggestions, ensuring the plugin remains at the forefront of user needs.

## Project Obsidian Plugin Installation

**Important:** Project Obsidian is a plugin, not a mod. Ensure you follow the correct installation steps.

1. Download the `ProjectObsidian.dll` file from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Xlinka/ProjectObsidian/releases).
2. Place the downloaded `ProjectObsidian.dll` file in the `Libraries` folder in your Resonite directory.
3. Add the `-LoadAssembly` launch argument followed by the plugin's file path: `-LoadAssembly Libraries/ProjectObsidian.dll`.

Upon doing this, start Resonite. Project Obsidian should be operational. For further details, refer to your logs.

For a comprehensive guide, please refer to our [installation wiki](https://github.com/Xlinka/ProjectObsidian/wiki/Installation).

# 설치방법

중요: 프로젝트 오브시디안은 모드가 아닌 플러그인 입니다. 설치 방법이 다르므로 주의하십시오.
먼저 Releases 탭에서 ProjectObsidian.dll 파일을 다운로드 받아 Resonite 설치 경로의 `Libraries` 폴더에 넣어주세요.
네오스에서 플러그인을 로드하도록 `-LoadAssembly` 실행 옵션을 추가하십시오.
이렇게 설정하면 Resonite를 시작할 때 Project Obsidian 플러그인이 로드되어야 합니다.
